1. Find out the type for the function, head, by typing this at
   the GHCi prompt.  "t" is short for "type".  (Remember that
   GHCi has TAB completion, so you can type :t he TAB).

      :t head

2. Ask GHCi about some more types.  See if you can find three
   functions from the previous exercises that have this type:

      (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]

3. Infix functions have types too.  Ask GHCi about (!!) by
   typing this:

      :t (!!)

4. Expressions also have types.  Ask GHCi the following.
   (Remember to use the up arrow to recall previous commands).

      :t not
      :t map
      :t map not
      :t map not [True,True,False]

5. Haskell can infer most types for us.  Load one of your earlier programs
   (factorial or average or palindrome or whatever), and ask GHCi what
   type your function has.

   It is considered good style to put types in your programs.  Therefore,
   paste that type in front of your function definition, and see if your
   program still loads.
